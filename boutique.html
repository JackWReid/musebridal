		<p>Muse is not only the perfect place for mothers of brides or grooms to choose an exquisite outfit but also for other wedding guests looking for something a little different to the high street chains.  Or maybe you would like a special outfit for a garden party, a day at the races, a party/cocktail dress or an evening gown for a black tie event.</p>
		<p>We understand that choosing such an outfit may sometimes seem a daunting task.  We enjoy sharing time to chat and listen to what you like, your thoughts, requirements and individual style and to offer ideas you may not have considered before! We aim for you to not only look, but more importantly feel, an elegant and fabulous you!</p>
		<p>Newly sourced designer labels have been carefully chosen and Muse is excited and proud to stock Carla Ruiz, a Spanish label who aim to ‘enhance female beauty and elegancy’.  Bernshaw evening wear grace the rails with ‘glamour and sophistication’ offering ‘affordable recreations of designer and Hollywood looks’ with Cabotine and Zeila giving ‘fashionable flair and great fit’. The collections are complemented by co-ordinating hats from Snoxells and exquisite handmade hatinators by designer Sarah Crozier.</p>
